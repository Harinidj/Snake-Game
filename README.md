🐍 Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python.

🎮 How It Works
The game is played within the terminal window.

Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

The objective is to collect food items, which increases the length of the snake.

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

📝 Notes
Ensure that Python is installed on your system to run the game.

No additional libraries are required; the game uses standard Python modules.

To start the game, run the snake.py file in your terminal.
